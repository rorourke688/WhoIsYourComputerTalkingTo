# WhoIsYourComputerTalkingTo
Final Year Project

This Repository contains the code for the custom program required by the specification.
In order to fully understand how each module works together you will need a basic understanding of Django.
However the core files and classes are all in the Home module.

File: Purpose
models.py: contains all the classes ie tables for the database
urls.py: contains all the URLs and directions the request to the specific backend logic
views.py: holds all the core logic for the program. Seleneium is started here and packet sniffing
Other files are mostly utility files so the views.py file doesnt get too large
